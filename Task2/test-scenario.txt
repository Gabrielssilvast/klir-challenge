Using Guerkin language I was able to analyze the following topics:

 - Interaction with the user on the welcome screen.
 - Verification of information on the Customer List screen.
 - Verification of detailed data on the contact details screen.

1) Scenario: User Interaction on Welcome Screen
    a) Given the user is on the Welcome Screen
    When the user fills the name field with Name, numbers or special characters
    And clicks the 'Submit' button
    Then the message "Hi <Name, numbers or special characters>. It is now <current_date> and here is our customer list. Click on each of them to view their contact details."
    And the Customer List is displayed

    b) Given the user is on the Welcome Screen
    When the user click on'Submit' leaving the field without any type of filling
    Then an alert is displayed with the message "Please provide your name"

2) Scenario: Checking Information on Customer List Screen
    a) Given the user is on the Customer List Screen
    Then the following information is displayed: "Name", "# of Employees" and "Size"
    And only the name column company will be clickable

    b) Given the user is on the Customer List Screen
    When a customer has "# of employees" less than or equal to 2500
    Then the Customer "Size" is Small
        Results: All small companies satisfy the condition

    c) Given the user is on the Customer List Screen
    When a customer has "# of employees" bigger than 2500 and less than or equal to 5000
    Then the Customer "Size" is Medium
        Results: Las Vegas Water Size: Big (Error: Expected "Medium")

    d) Given the user is on the Customer List Screen
    When a customer has "# of employees" bigger than 5000
    Then the Customer "Size" is Big
        Results: Las Vegas Water Size: Big (Error: Expected "Medium")

    e) Given the user is on the Customer List Screen
    When the user clicks on a customer name
    Then the Contacts Detail Screen is shown
        Results:Las Vegas Water         OK
                Los Angels Water        OK
                San Francisco's Water   OK
                New York's Water        OK
                Miami's Water           OK
                Chicago's Water         OK
                Denver's Water          Error: Only an empty page is displayed. Expected: Show this the message **No contact info available**

3) Scenario: Checking Detailed Information on Contacts Detail Screen
    a) Given the user is on the Customer List Screen
    When the user clicks on a customer name
    Then the screen shows the customer's detailed info (Name, # of Employees, Size and a Contact person with your e-mail address)
    And the "name" and "email" of the contact person in the company are displayed
        Results:Las Vegas Water         OK
                Los Angels Water        OK
                San Francisco's Water   OK
                New York's Water        Error: Only the contact e-mail appears.(Expected: Contact Person and E-mail address)
